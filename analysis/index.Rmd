Welcome to me learning about ATAC-sequencing!

Good luck to me for this process. I will update as I learn more.

For my first page:
[Fastqc analysis of ATAC data](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/ATAC_learning/Fastqc_results.html)

For my second page: (in which I attempt to take my pre-processing data and attempt QC analysis for ATAC data)  
[Read counts and Peak calling](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/ATAC_learning/Peak_calling.html)
