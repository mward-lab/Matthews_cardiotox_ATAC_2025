## ATAC-seq of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes


This page is often under construction, due to the long list of analysis I am doing.

For my first page: Sequencing QC analysis
[Fastqc analysis of ATAC data](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/ATAC_learning/Fastqc_results.html)

For my second page: 

[Read counts and Peak calling](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/ATAC_learning/Peak_calling.html)


For my a third page:  Examination of DAR for 6 individuals and 4(1,2,3,6) individuals

[Examination of Peak characteristics](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/ATAC_learning/Peak_analysis.html)

For my fourth and fifth pages:


[Cormotif Analysis for all 6](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/ATAC_learning/CorMotif_data.html)

[Cormotif Analysis for 1,2,3,6](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/ATAC_learning/CorMotif_data_n45.html)
